## Introduction

In this project, we will evaluate the King County housing data set and try to predict housing prices with a linear regression model.

## Objectives
* Model King County housing dataset to predict housing prices
* Describe which features are most predictive of price
* Explore any other nuances in the data
* Explore which features give you the best deal.

## 1. Explore and Clean the Data

In this section we will place all import statements then clean the data.We'll check out scatterplot and histograms for irregularities / outliers and remove as necessary. Then we'll separate categorical and continuous data. 

## 2. Categorical Data

Categorical data will get dummy variables

## 3. Continuous Data
Continuous data will be scaled and logged as neccessary. Next we'll look at colinearity.

## 4. Feature Selection

Define techniques for stepwise selection and backward selection.

## 5. Create Models

Use the selection techniques to select variables and then actually use them in the models.

## 6. Refine the final Model

Refine the final model using polynomial and interaction terms as required.

## 7. Model Validation

Use train-test splits and k-fold cross validation to validate the model.

## 8. Interpret the model

Use the model to answer our objectives. First we'll print out the final model coefficients and create a visualization to show which terms / features were the most import.  Then we will go through the model coefficients and explore why bedrooms has a negative coefficient. Lastly, we will attempt to find the best and worst housing deals looking at our residuals.
